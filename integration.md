## üîß Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Frontend Test Initialization** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: App component starts in intro/setup mode during tests  
**Impact**: Prevents testing of main game functionality  
**Root Cause**: Multi-phase app initialization not handled in test environment  
**Fix Required**: Mock initial state or add test utility to skip intro

### 2. **Game Engine API Inconsistency** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Function return formats don't match test expectations  
**Impact**: 6/19 game engine tests failing  
**Examples**: 
- `applyAction()` returns `cost` but tests expect `timeCost`
- `canAccuse()` returns boolean but tests expect `{allowed: boolean}`
**Fix Required**: Standardize API contracts or update test expectations

### 3. **Component Integration Gaps** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Some component interactions not fully testable  
**Impact**: 12/16 component tests failing  
**Root Cause**: Missing React imports, async state handling issues  
**Fix Required**: Complete component test mocks and async handling

### 4. **Error Boundary Coverage** (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue**: No React Error Boundaries implemented  
**Impact**: Potential crashes not gracefully handled  
**Recommendation**: Add error boundaries around major components

## üö® Technical Debt Assessment

### **High Priority Issues**
1. **Monolithic App.jsx**: 4,765 lines handling all game logic
   - **Risk**: Difficult to maintain, test, and debug
   - **Recommendation**: Extract dialogue, evidence, and state management into separate modules

2. **No Error Boundaries**: React crashes could break entire game
   - **Risk**: Poor user experience during errors
   - **Recommendation**: Implement error boundaries for major component sections

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Limited frontend integration test coverage
   - **Risk**: Regressions in core game functionality
   - **Recommendation**: Complete test suite implementation after fixing init issues

### **Medium Priority Issues**
1. **API Contract Inconsistencies**: Mixed return formats across game engine functions
2. **Character Detection Over-sensitivity**: Mentioned in existing documentation  
3. **State Race Conditions**: Async state updates causing conflicts

### **Low Priority Issues**
1. **Bundle Size**: Large single-page app could impact mobile performance
2. **CSS Organization**: Styles could benefit from CSS modules or styled-components
3. **TypeScript Migration**: Would catch API inconsistencies and improve maintainability
